# hello-world
Just getting familiar with using Github. Nothing to see here. Move along...

I've been learning Python and Django and have just recently completed everything in the excellent book, "Python Crash Course".
I've built a couple of simple cli and web apps and have used git locally on my laptop, but now I want to start getting things
into github so they can be viewed and shared with others.

This project is just an initial practice area for getting familiar with Github, so I don't mess up a real project.
